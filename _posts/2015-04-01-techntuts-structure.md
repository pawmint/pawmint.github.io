## How to contribute to the Tech'N'Tuts?

### Publishing guidelines

* For a long post, please consider starting with a table of contents (using anchors). It will take you a bit of time to write it, but make our reading much more pleasant.
* When you make a major contribution to a post, please tag yourself on it.

### How to discuss the content

Unlike wikipedia, the discussions over Tech'n'Tuts shouldn't take place inside the pages.
Depending on the nature of the discussion, you should switch back to *Slack* or *Basecamp* for a real discussion thread.

However, there are still a few simple discussions that you can do from Tech'N'Tuts.

* First, on any page, you can add some TODO/FIXME or some minor remarks (please not the page as *incomplete* in the [TODO](#todo) section).
* Second, on this page you can make some more general remark/TODO about the global structure of the the Tech'N'Tuts.

If your remark are subjective, please make your name appear on it

Moreover, don't forget that Tech'N'Tuts is under a Git versioning. If you want to make some uncertain change without directly affecting what other will see, you can always work in another branch.

## Discussions

#### Pages we could create

Romain: A little braindump. I've tried to be as exhaustive as possible, but we probably shouldn't document everything I've listed. Please add what I have forgotten, move the one you don't want to [Pages we should not create](#pages-we-should-not-create). Once we're a bit stable about what we want, we'll clean it up and rework the categories.

* Reasoning
* Semantic web
* Ubismart Technical overview
    * Provide an overview of all our system, with links to each tool's specific post
* Ubisimu
* Data analysis
* Sensors
    * Bed sensor
* Administrative procedures
    * Internships, visa...
    * Making orders
    * Running a mission
    * Ongoing projects (QoL, VHP...)
    * LIRMM or IPAL specifics
* Setting up a working system (for interns)
* Remote development, Digital ocean, etc.
* Available Datasets
* State of the art: teams working on our topics, important papers, etc.
* Rejected approaches (and why)
* Smartphone notifications
* UbismartOSGi

Romain: As an alternative use, we may also use Tech'N'Tuts as a journal log and/or as a roadmap. I'm not sure myself that it is really relevant, so please give your input.

#### Pages we should not create

## Todo

* A Welcome page that will be used as a guide
* Completely rethink the current structure
* A README
* A cool favicon with the pawmint logo

#### Empty pages

* [Normandie]({% post_url 2015-03-01-normandie %})
* [Git tips]({% post_url 2015-03-01-git-tips %})
* [Tmux tips]({% post_url 2015-03-01-tmux-tips %})

#### Incomplete pages
