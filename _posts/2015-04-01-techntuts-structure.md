## How to contribute to the Tech'N'Tuts?

### Publishing guidelines

* For a long post, please consider starting with a table of contents (using anchors). It will take you a bit of time to write it, but make our reading much more pleasant.
* When you make a major contribution to a post, please tag yourself on it.

### How to discuss the content

Unlike wikipedia, the discussions over Tech'n'Tuts shouldn't take place inside the pages.
Depending on the nature of the discussion, you should switch back to *Slack* or *Basecamp* for a real discussion thread.

However, there are still a few simple discussions that you can do from Tech'N'Tuts.

* First, on any page, you can add some TODO/FIXME or some minor remarks (please not the page as *incomplete* in the [TODO](#todo) section).
* Second, on this page you can make some more general remark/TODO about the global structure of the the Tech'N'Tuts.

If your remark are subjective, please make your name appear on it

Moreover, don't forget that Tech'N'Tuts is under a Git versioning. If you want to make some uncertain change without directly affecting what other will see, you can always work in another branch.
