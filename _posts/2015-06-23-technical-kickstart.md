# Setup your coding environment:


## Get the right OS

You need to install an appropriate OS for development on your computer:

* If you have a Mac, you are all set
* If you have Windows, you might want to install Linux in double boot. Therefore, follow carefully [this tutorial] (http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/cohabitation_ubuntu_windows)


Once you have the right OS on your computer, it will be time for you to learn how to use the Terminal: basically, instead of using a mouse and the interface you are used to, you will communicate with your computer through command lines, in shell language. You can learn how to do this by following  [this tutorial] (http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) !

## Install a setup & dotfiles

## SSH (secured communication protocol)

Our team bought virtual machines on Amazon, those are located in Amsterdam and Singapore. This allows us to connect and work from our local machines (used as a simple interface) on our virtual machines (which processes the programs). This communication is based on the SSH protocol, here's a very clear tutorial on how it works, and how to implement it: (http://openclassrooms.com/courses/reprenez-le-controle-a-l-aide-de-linux/la-connexion-securisee-a-distance-avec-ssh)
