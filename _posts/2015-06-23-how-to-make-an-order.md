# Ordering process

First of all, find your items on the store.

Then you need to obtain a quote. Some website directly have a button "Quote" ("Devis" in French), sometimes from your shopping list or in the ordering process; if this is the case, just download the quote and you are good to go. Otherwise you'll have to contact the customer service to ask for a quote. Here is a template of email (in French and English):

In French:

> (Subject: Demande de devis)
>
> (From: Your mines-telecom address)
>
> Bonjour,
>
> J'aimerais obtenir un devis au nom de l'Institut Mines-Télécom, pour les produits suivants [or "pour les produits ci-joint" if you attach a list]. Le paiement s'effectuera par bon de commande.
>
> - Product1 xQUANTITY (URL)
> - Product2 xQUANTITY (URL)
>
> L'adresse de livraison sera:
>
>> M. Romain Endelin
>>
>> Campus St Priest - LIRMM BAT 5
>>
>> 860 rue de St Priest
>>
>> 34095 Montpellier cedex 5
> 
>
> Et l'adresse de facturation:
>
>> M. Mounir Mokhtari
>>
>> INSTITUT MINES TELECOM
>>
>> 46 RUE BARRAULT
>>
>> 75634 PARIS CEDEX 13
>>
>> FRANCE 
>
>
> Bien cordialement,
>
> Romain Endelin
>
> (your signature)

In English:

> (Subject: Quote Enquiry)
>
> (From: Your mines-telecom address)
>
> Dear sir,
>
> I would like to obtain a quote in the name of Institut Mines-Télécom (a French public institute), for the following items [or "for the attached items" if you attach a list]. Do you accept NET30 payment?
>
> - Product1 x<quantity> (<url>)
> - Product2 x<quantity> (<url>)
>
> The delivery address is:
>> M. Romain Endelin
>>
>> Campus St Priest - LIRMM BAT 5

I strongly advise you go to French companies first. European is still okay. Beyond that it is very hard, as many companies don't accept payment by purchase order (a.k.a Net30, "Bon de commande" in French), or sometimes it is only after a very complicated registration process. Also, international shipping may be subject to boundary fees, that you will have to pay yourself before you'll be reimbursed.

Once you get the quote, forward it to Sophie Millat (sophie.millat@mines-telecom.fr), with Mounir in CC. You should also ask Mounir what budget line will be used, and tell it to Sophie.

From this point, normally everything is done, and you just have to wait. In case or problem/doubt, just call Sophie.
