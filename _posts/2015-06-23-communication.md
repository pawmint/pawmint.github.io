# Instant messaging: **Slack**

Most of our daily communication happens on [slack](https://pawm.slack.com). We use the following general-purpose channels:

* **Announcements**: To broadcast announcements to the team. Please start your messages by *"Dear ladies and gentleman, it is my great pleasure..."* :p.
* **Code**: Talking of our codes, related to pawmint
* **General**: Daily discussion, with no specific topic, but still related to pawmint
* **Github**: Automatic channel to get a stream of github events
* **Literature**: Share your interesting articles
* **Onething**: Tell us what you're doing, so you'll be more committed to it
* **Pivotal**: Automatic channel to get a stream of pivotal events
* **Publishing**: Talking about our own publications
* **Random**: Post Youtube videos of cats ;)
* **Techtalk**: Some articles/discussions about IT, possibly open ideas for our system


Additionnally, we have a couple of more specific channels where you may register or not, depending on your interest. At the time this page is written these are the following (be aware that it may be outdated when you read it):

* **Normandie**: Speaking specifically about our deployment in Normandie
* **Ubigate-dev**: Talking of the dev in ubigate, and the home-gateway in general
* **Sails-dev**: Talking of the Ubismart dev
* **Thesis**: Following Romain's thesis

We also have a few private groups, among which:

* **Minibosses**: Who knows what happens in there...
* **Lirmm**: Where Romain says when he'll be late
* **IPAL**: Where Thibaut beats up his intern

Oh, another very important command in slack: `\giphy`. Try it out yourself ;).

# Visioconf

We usually use **Google Hangout** or **Appear.in** for visio-conf. You can run a session directly from **Slack** by typing `/hangout` or `/appear <room-name>`

### 24/7 Camera between LIRMM and IPAL

That would be cool, isn't it?
