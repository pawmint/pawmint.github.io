# Regular review

We do a regular cleanup of all our tools:

* Trello
* Slack (topics)
* Tech'N'Tuts
* Github
* Pivotal
* Box

For **Trello**, we do that review ideally once a month, and for the other tools, once every two months. Ideally everyone should be involved, and we can easily split tasks once we're at it.

Spontaneous reviews/cleanup from time to time are also more than welcome, especially on **Trello**.

To keep tracks of our reviews, we simply use a calendar event, and we create the next cleanup event after the current cleanup is finished.
