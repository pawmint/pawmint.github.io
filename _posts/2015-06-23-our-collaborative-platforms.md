# Communication

## Slack

Most of our daily communication happens on [slack](https://pawm.slack.com). We use the following channels:

* **Code**: Talking of our codes, related to pawmint
* **General**: Daily discussion, with no specific topic, but still related to pawmint
* **Github**: Automatic channel to get a stream of github events
* **Literature**: Share your interesting articles
* **Normandie**: Speaking specifically about our deployment in Normandie
* **Onething**: Tell us what you're doing, so you'll be more committed to it
* **Pivotal**: Automatic channel to get a stream of pivotal events
* **Publishing**: Talking about our own publications
* **Random**: Post Youtube videos of cats ;)
* **Techtalk**: Some articles/discussions about IT, possibly open ideas for our system

For PhD students/Postdocs only:

* **Minibosses**: That's a secret... Trash talking about the interns ? Or perhaps planning to conquer the world

## Visio-conf

No specific application for VOIP/Video-call. We usually use **google hangout** or **skype**

## Basecamp

We use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) for simple collaborative documents and asynchronous discussions (whereas slack is synchronous). We use the **Pawmint** project

Basecamp may also be used for TODO-lists, although we don't use it on a daily basis.

### Calendar

Basecamp also provides a calendar, to which you can subscribe on the iCalendar format.

## Box

We use [Box](https://box.com) for file sharing and to work on collaborative documents.

# Development

## Github

Our codes are shared under the **Github** [Pawmint organisation](https://github.com/pawmint/). We are authorized to have up to 20 private repos, plus unlimited public repos. Thus, we usually put our critical codes as private, while the less critical can remain public.

TODO: Link to the Git tutorial.

## Pivotal Tracker

We organize our development using the **scrum** method, thanks to (Pivotal tracker)[https://www.pivotaltracker.com]. Our most active project currently is **Ubismart V3**, although some other projects should rely on Pivotal as well.

## Pair programming

We can pair-program using SSH + Tmux. Reverse proxies may help to share a SSH session on the Internet, or to forward your server running on localhost.
TODO: Describe it, or refer to an article that describes it.

# Openings (not implemented)

* Collaborative documents through etherpad. For instance through https://etherpad.in2p3.fr/ (CNRS approved)
* File sharing using Seafile (already integrated in LIRMM, but not for Singapore)
* Replacing Github by Gitlab
