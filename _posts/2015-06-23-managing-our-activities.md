**GETTING STARTED**

# Trello basic use and tricks

Check out https://trello.com/guide first.

* Assign related member to a card if you want some feedback
* Don't hesitate to abuse attachements, checklists, comments, markdown formatting, etc. as long as it is useful

# Structure of our trello

## The PAWMint board

So far this board contains everything. You are free to create other boards for sub-project if you feel good about it.
The most complete workflow is:

1. Dump anything into inbox
2. Move the card to discussion, refine it a little, notify people who are related, and let it be discussed
3. When you have a clear idea of what is to be done, move it to the Icebox
4. When you are committed to do it, move it to backlog
5. When you're actually doing it, move it to current
6. When it's finished, move it to inbox
7. When you have no more retrospectives/feedback to do, archive the card

Of course you don't always need to be that formal, you can shortcut many steps, depending on your needs.

## Labels

## Mention members

You should browse through Trello once in a while and subscribe to the cards for which you want to receive updates. To do this, simply press space bar when hovering on a card. A good example is the retrospective of the people you work with!

Similarly, when you expect a reaction from someone, don't forget to make him member on this card.

You can also check out the latest activities on a board in the menu on the right side.
