# Structure of our trello

## The PAWMint board

So far [the PAWMint board](https://trello.com/b/gQLL3PGn/pawmint) contains everything. You are free to create other boards for sub-project if you feel good about it.
The most complete workflow is:

1. Dump anything into inbox
2. Move the card to discussion, refine it a little, notify people who are related, and let it be discussed
3. When you have a clear idea of what is to be done, move it to the Icebox
4. When you are committed to do it, move it to backlog
5. When you're actually doing it, move it to current
6. When it's finished, move it to inbox
7. When you have no more retrospectives/feedback to do, archive the card

Of course you don't always need to be that formal, you can shortcut many steps, depending on your needs.

The columns `Projects & Partnership`, `Long-term` and `Retrospective` are a bit special:

* `Projects & Partnership` helps us keep tracks of who we are working for.
* `Long-term` is for discussion that are persistent over weeks or months, with sometimes actionable stuffs coming out of it.
* `Retrospective` should be done each week, by commenting on your card.

## Labels

1. Deployments
2. Demos
3. Reasoning
4. Gateway / Home
5. Webapp
6. Admin
7. Team Life
8. Academic / Publishing
9. Project Leads

## Tip & Tricks

* Don't hesitate to abuse attachements, checklists, comments, markdown formatting, etc. as long as it is useful
* If you contribute to a project, please add yourself as a member of the corresponding card (`<space>`). If you just want to receives update from that card (although you don't want to appear as a member), just subscribe to it with `s`.

### Mentionning members

You should browse through Trello once in a while and subscribe to the cards for which you want to receive updates. To do this, simply press space bar when hovering on a card. A good example is the retrospective of the people you work with! Similarly, when you expect a reaction from someone, don't forget to make him member on this card.

It is also possible to mention people within comments or inside checklist tasks.

You can then check out the latest activities on a board in the menu on the right side.
