# Setup a coding environment (the vim way):

    Note: That's a very rough guide...

You'll find a vim and tmux basic config file on : https://gist.github.com/RomainEndelin/70e3863822e699edae40

## Vim

Start with reading the `.vimrc` (and following what's written in the headers). Then start learning the basics with http://www.labnol.org/internet/learning-vim-for-beginners/28820/ (the first link they give sounds good to me). Also make sure you have this cheatsheet open somewhere ;).

## Tmux

Put `.tmux.conf` in your home folder. Start with http://www.sitepoint.com/tmux-a-simple-start/, but please notice that in your setup Ctrl-B has been replaced by Ctrl-A (which is much more convenient!), and the arrows have been replaced by hjkl (vim-style).

### Pair programming on same tmux session

- To join the `ubi` tmux session with your own user session: `tmux new-session -t ubi -s <nameit>`
- To get dynamically sized windows: `tmux setw -g aggressive-resize on`
